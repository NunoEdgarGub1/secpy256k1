/** Opaque data structure that holds context information (precomputed tables etc.).
 *
 *  The purpose of context structures is to cache large precomputed data tables
 *  that are expensive to construct, and also to maintain the randomization data
 *  for blinding.
 *
 *  Do not create a new context object for each operation, as construction is
 *  far slower than all other API calls (~100 times slower than an ECDSA
 *  verification).
 *
 *  A constructed context can safely be used from multiple threads
 *  simultaneously, but API call that take a non-const pointer to a context
 *  need exclusive access to it. In particular this is the case for
 *  secp256k1_context_destroy and secp256k1_context_randomize.
 *
 *  Regarding randomization, either do it once at creation time (in which case
 *  you do not need any locking for the other calls), or use a read-write lock.
